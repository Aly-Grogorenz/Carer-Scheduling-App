This repository hosts all my work done on a carer scheduling app for the University of Exeter.

In essence, this project deals with a variation of the multiple Travelling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows. See the accompanying Master's Thesis for more context.

The code itself is main.py and requires the cccmd.kv, functions.py, tr.csv, and me_32.png files to run. 
Information to be uploaded once the app is running is found in the clients_carers_data.xlsx

There are two accompanying Word documents that further detail the use of the app. 
The Carer Scheduling App Guide documents provides a step-by-step break down on how to properly use the app. 
The Carer Scheduling Technical Guide provides further insight into the code and lists ideas for further development of the app.
